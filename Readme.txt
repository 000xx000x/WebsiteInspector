This Python script, written by Darshan B, retrieves and displays information about a website’s security, server, and OS. It uses the requests module to send a GET request to a specified URL and extracts specific security headers from the response. It also attempts to detect the server and OS information from the response headers and text, respectively. The script is organized in a class-based structure for better scalability and maintenance. It includes error handling for connection errors and timeouts. To run the script, you need Python 3.x and the requests module. You can run it from the terminal with the command python filename.py, replacing “filename” with the name of your Python file. When prompted, enter the website link. The script will then retrieve and display the website information. Note that the accuracy of the OS detection may vary, and not all websites disclose their server information or implement the checked security headers.
